# Search-Cities-Using-Geonames

A Simple POC that searches cities by name using the Geonames API.

To use this application, you need to change the username located on the Utils/GeonamesSearch.swift by your own username. 

If you don't have an username, you can create one for free at http://www.geonames.org/login
